After all I've managed to create my own blog. I'll share my thoughts and experiences in software development through out this blog.

As you may have noticed I'm using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  The benefit of using it is a lot. 
Here are quite a few benefits to be gained from jekyll:

 - Everything is just text and files
 - No SQL, SQL backups etc.
 - Comments are now just messages in my email inbox
 - No hosting costs- It can be hosted on github pages
 - Using github as source control

>The most significant feature is I'm in full control of my blog structure, design, theme and so on.

You can see the code behind my blog [here](https://github.com/hogaf/hogaf.github.io).
